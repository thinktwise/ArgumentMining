When a habeas petitioner s claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings,28 U.S.C. 2254(d)forecloses relief unless the state court s adjudica- tion of the claim: (1)resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly es- tablished Federal law,as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;or (2)resulted in a decision that was based on an un- reasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. The jury-coercion claim in respondent s habeas petition is the same claim rejected on the merits in his direct appeal to the state appellate court,and the Ninth Circuit cor- rectly recognized that 2254(d)was therefore applicable. It held that respondent had established that the decision of the Court of Appeal was contrary to established federal law for two,and possibly three,reasons.We think none of them correct.

My wifes family has many relatives that work in the prison system in NY state. At one wedding we attended a date of one of her brothers was arguing for a novel approach to prison overcrowding and abuses, her idea was to just throw open the doors and let them all out. The idea was funny enough that everyone laughed. Seriously though, I think that some people would be more cowed by taking thirty lashes than sitting in a prison for ten years, and that would certainly be cheaper than incarceration, you do the crime, you get convicted, you are punished, and the punishments over, you paid your debt and can get on with life.

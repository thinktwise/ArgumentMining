Sir William Muir once stated  Our authorities all agree in ascribing to the youth of Muhammad a modesty of deportment and purity of manners rare among Meccans.  During his youth Muhammad never once touched wine nor engaged in any game of gambling nor did he even begin to develop a liking to war in which the Arabs of his time were constantly engaged in. Certainly these characteristics were unusual in a man surrounded by a society indulged in all forms of idolatry and immorality.","type":"I","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:39"},{"nodeID":"358","text":"Nor did Muhammad develop a fond of wealth and not once was he energetic in pursuit of riches. Muhammad would've have rather spent his time in prayer or in solitude during much of his youth. When young he become a member of the Hilfal-Fudzul an alliance formed to vindicate the rights of the weak and help the plight of the poor. He spent to help those who were poor after marrying the wealthy widow Khadija and in every instance did he free a slave who entered his household.     Imam Ghazali the great Islamic scholar summed up the Prophet (saas)'s treatment of those around him in light of the information found in the hadiths:  ... Everyone thought that the Prophet honoured him more...  He was affectionate towards everyone never interupted their speech no matter how short or long always was the first to stretch his hand to greet and the last to let go. He greeted everyone with a smile and left with a smile.","type":"I","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"359","text":"If someone who claims to have received divine revelation is known by those who are close to him to have an outstanding moral character and a trustworthy personality that person is known by them to have received divine revelation.","type":"I","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"360","text":"Muhammad claimed to have received divine revelation","type":"I","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"361","text":"RA","type":"RA","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"362","text":"RA","type":"RA","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"363","text":"RA","type":"RA","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:40"},{"nodeID":"364","text":"RA","type":"RA","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:41"},{"nodeID":"365","text":"RA","type":"RA","timestamp":"2012-04-12 17:18:41"}],"edges":[{"edgeID":"327","fromID":"348","toID":"361","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"328","fromID":"349","toID":"361","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"329","fromID":"361","toID":"347","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"330","fromID":"350","toID":"362","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"331","fromID":"351","toID":"362","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"332","fromID":"362","toID":"348","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"333","fromID":"352","toID":"363","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"334","fromID":"353","toID":"363","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"335","fromID":"354","toID":"363","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"336","fromID":"363","toID":"350","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"337","fromID":"355","toID":"364","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"338","fromID":"356","toID":"364","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"339","fromID":"364","toID":"347","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"340","fromID":"357","toID":"365","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"341","fromID":"358","toID":"365","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"342","fromID":"359","toID":"365","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"343","fromID":"360","toID":"365","formEdgeID":null},{"edgeID":"344","fromID":"365","toID":"355","formEdgeID":null}],"locutions":[{"nodeID":"347","personID":"1224","timestamp":"2015-09-25 14:12:34","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"348","personID":"1224","timestamp":"2015-09-25 14:12:34","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"349","personID":"0","timestamp":"2015-09-25 14:12:34","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"350","personID":"1224","timestamp":"2015-09-25 14:12:34","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"351","personID":"1224","timestamp":"2015-09-25 14:12:34","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"352","personID":"413","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"353","personID":"4","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"354","personID":"4","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"355","personID":"4","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"356","personID":"510","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"357","personID":"510","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"358","personID":"510","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"359","personID":"510","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:23:18","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"360","personID":"4","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"361","personID":"413","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"362","personID":"413","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"363","personID":"4","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"364","personID":"413","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null},{"nodeID":"365","personID":"413","timestamp":"2015-09-29 10:26:20","start":null,"end":null,"source":null}]}

Yet tackling the problem can prove complex. In China, 95% of movies get pirated. "After 70 years of communism, they don t always understand or appreciate the concept of intellectual property rights," lamented Robert A. Lutz, Vice-Chairman, Product Development and Chairman, GM North America, General Motors Corporation, USA. He recounted his efforts nine years ago to stop "reverse engineering". A Chinese manufacturer dropped a reproduced frame of a Jeep Cherokee onto the chassis of a Soviet pickup, then externally adorned it with real chrome parts from California Jeep dealers. The "kind woman at the top" told Lutz: "I don t see what the problem is. As we understand capitalism, if someone makes a product better than you and cheaper, they deserve the market. Our government is not about to crack down on local business manufacturers." http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Counterfeiting%3A%20What%20Needs%20to%20Be%20Done%3F_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

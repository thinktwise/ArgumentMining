We believe that the liberation of the Iraqi people after decades of tyranny provides an opportunity for Iraq, for the Iraqi people, to chart a course to freedom and prosperity. Their success will create an example that can be used for the region and other parts of the world. The stakes in Iraq are high for all of us. That s why all who want a Middle East that is at peace, that s prosperous, that s culturally vital and politically free, must join together to succeed in Iraq, to make sure that Iraq succeeds. You can be sure of the determination of the United States, of the determination of President Bush and of the American people, to see this through to the end. The despotic regime has been removed. A regime that filled mass graves; a regime that squandered the resources of its people. That regime is not coming back. Now we all must come together to put in place a government that is so different from the regime that is gone, a government that rests on democracy and freedom, the rights of men and women. A government that will live in peace with its neighbors. A government that will be an example to the rest of the region. http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Remarks+by+US+Secretary+of+State+Colin+Powell

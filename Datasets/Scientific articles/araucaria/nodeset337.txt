And you know very well too that all the wrongs the Greeks suffered from the Lacedaemonians or from us, they at least suffered at the hands of true-born sons of Greece. It was just what happens in a noble house when a legitimate son manages his estate badly. He certainly deserves blame and reproach, but it cannot be said that he was not the legitimate heir, or he has no rights to the property. But if some slave or suppositious son were ruining and spoiling property to which he had no title, how much more scandalous and intolerable everybody would have though it! Yet they show no such feeling with regard to Philip and his present actions, although not only he is not a Greek, and has nothing in common with the Greeks, but is not even a barbarian with an honourable origin!

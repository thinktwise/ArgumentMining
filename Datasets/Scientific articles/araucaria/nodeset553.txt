>For starters, there is no guarantee that this military adventure will, in fact, lead to a "regime change", or peace and stability for your region. In the balance are not only the dead and mutilated of Iraq (and who knows how many from the invading force), but the very real possibility that such an act of pre-emptive world-destabilising aggression could spin out of control and lead to other despots pre-emptively arming themselves with all manner of apocalyptic weapons and, perhaps, to Armageddon. And if we add that I am unconvinced, along with so many others in the world, that your dictator has sufficient weapons of mass destruction truly to pose a threat to other countries or ties to criminal groups who could use them for terror, I have to say no to war.

Eight-month-old Kyle Mutch's tragic death was not an accident and he suffered injuries consistent with a punch or a kick, a court heard yesterday. The baby, whose stepfather denies murder, was examined by pathologist Dr James Grieve shortly after his death. Dr. Grieve told the High Court at Forfar the youngest was covered in bruises and had suffered a crushed intestine as well as severe internal bleeding. When asked by Advocate Depute Mark Stewart, prosecuting, if the bruises could have been caused by an accident, he said "No. Not in a child that is not walking, not toddling and has not been in a motor car." Dr. Grieve said the injuries had happened "pretty quickly" and would be "difficult for an infant to cope with". The lecturer in forensic medicines at Aberdeen University told the jury that the bruises could have been caused by a single blow from a blunt instrument, like a closed hand.

Predestination. Dr. Curley presents the following argument: 1. Predestination is incompatible with God's love and justice. 2. Predestination is taught in the Bible. 3. Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist. 6. Now I agree with his first premise, but I deny the second, that predestination, as he defines it, is taught in the Bible. On the contrary, I think that the Bible teaches that it is God's will that every single person be saved. II Peter 3:9 states, "God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance." And I Timothy 2:4 says, "God, our Savior, desires all persons to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." So God's will is that everyone be saved, and the only obstacle to His will coming true is human freedom. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html

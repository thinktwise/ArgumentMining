He must wait for the monsoon to set in before he gets so uppity about what economists can do for him. He will need all their creativity to explain away rising inflation and a subdued capital market. This is a good budget, but it is based on a gamble. If the gamble works, Singh can still hope to get that widely coveted prize that eluded Yashwant Sinha for five years, the global Best Finance Minister award. But if growth remains below par - by which I mean below 6.0 per cent - and inflation moves upwards, Singh will see all this praise melt away. Nothing angers the middle class more than inflation and that is a threat a Singh tenure at the fisc certainly faces. It will also dampen demand that Singh so desperately needs to make his strategy click.

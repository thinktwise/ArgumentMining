For another thing,as JUSTICE STEVENS and I have previously pointed out,the combination of uncertainty of execution and long delay is arguably "cruel". This Court has recognized that such a combination can inflict "horrible feelings " and "an immense mental anxiety amounting to a great increase of the offender's punishment". In re Medley ,134 U.S.160,172 (1890); see also Furman v. Georgia ,408 U.S 238,288-289 (1972)(per curiam) (BRENNAN,J.,concurring)("[T ]he prospect of pending execution exacts a frightful toll "). Courts of other nations have found that delays of 15 years or less can render capital punishment degrading,shocking,or cruel. E.g., Pratt v. Attorney General for Jamaica ,[1994 ] 2 A..C.1,29, 33,4 All E.R.769,783,786 (P.C.1993)(en banc)(U.K. Privy Council);Soering v .United Kingdom ,11 Eur.Ct. H.R.(ser.A), pp.439,478,111 (1989)(European Court of Human Rights). See Knight ,supra ,at 995-996. Consistent with these determinations, the Supreme Court of Canada recently held that the potential for lengthy incarceration before execution is "a relevant consideration" when determining whether extradition to the United States violates principles of "fundamental justice".

While I feel dreadfully sorry for Ken Bigley and his family, after watching the latest video of him chained up, kept in a small cage, dressed in a orange boiler suit. It occurred to me that his situation is very similar to those being kept in Guantanamo bay. Blair condemns the treatment of Ken Bigley but never speaks out about the treatment of the men locked up illegally by his buddy Bush. Double standards me thinks. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3701582.stm

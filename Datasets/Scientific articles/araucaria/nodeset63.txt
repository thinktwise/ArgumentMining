Let me cut to the chase. When I look at the facts, it seems to me that there should be a travel advisory out warning tourists against travel to any city on this planet. All US Embassies should retreat to safer cover - probably on another planet, for it is hard to see where on earth, in the US and out of it, they would be immune to attack. All Americans, in and out of the US, should probably wear protective armor, include bioterror suits, from an early age.

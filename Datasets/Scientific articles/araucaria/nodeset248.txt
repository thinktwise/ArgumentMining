And about Peter; you ve got to know. I am not married. I am not Mrs. MacNair. I have never been married at all. I went to Canada ten years ago and while I was alone there I met Captain MacNair and lived with him. We were never married, but I lived with him a long time as his wife and called myself Mrs. MacNair.... Why didn t you get married? he interrupted. Was he married already? No; and we did intend to really, at some time, but we kept putting it off and putting it off until in the end it did not seem worth while; and a year or two ago we separated, finally. Well then, my lovely scandalous one! He laughed and shook her. You are not somebody else s wife, not even a widow, and you can marry whom you like. (Coppard 1935, 286-287)

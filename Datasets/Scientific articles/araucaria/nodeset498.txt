This argument is what we often call an argument from the best explanation. Arguments from the best explanation work in a certain way. They argue for something by pointing to a phenomenon, or pointing to something that occurs, and saying, "Look, you can't explain the occurrence of this, without postulating this." Dr. Craig is claiming you can't explain the existence of the universe without postulating God. God is either the explanation or is at least the very best explanation for this event. Well I think that even if you grant almost all of Dr. Craig's argument; grant that the probabilities are infinitesimally small or very, very small; grant the phenomena that he wants to explain, you really don't have to draw this conclusion.[12] I think this argument is sort of apparent to anybody. Today I bought a lottery ticket. The Lotto wasn't won last night. It's up to seven million. A lot of people are playing this right now. The fact is, it's extraordinary unlikely that I'm going to win this. In fact, the drawing has already taken place. (I think it takes place around six o'clock.) I probably didn't win. But let's suppose I did win. Suppose I won this lottery. It's extremely unlikely event that just might have come true. From the fact that I won this lottery, that this extremely improbable event happened, do I have any right to assume that somebody arranged this? Either the lottery manager, my friends in high places, or God? No, no you don't. http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/corey_washington/craig-washington/washington1.html

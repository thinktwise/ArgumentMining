While well-represented at the local and state levels by our elected officials, we are often ignored by the representatives to the North, our lives are detrimentally dictated by the governments of the North, our businesses are regulated at the whim of the Northern regulators. The fine citizens and businesses of Southern and Southwestern Oregon (Northern Jefferson) should and can have better lives, better economics, a better future for our children, if separated from the Counties in the North. http://sierratimes.com/04/02/08/ar_jefferson.htm

Increasing evidence suggests that many hostages died because they were not given basic medical care immediately after their rescue. Television images showed special forces placing on bare concrete unconscious hostages, who were then left utterly unattended. Footage indicated that no doctors were available outside the theater at that time. Russian authorities continue to withhold vital information about the gas, even though it is of key importance to medical doctors who are still treating hostages-some of whom are still in grave condition-and to survivors, who may face long-term health consequences. According to reliable sources who spoke to Human Rights Watch, doctors from several humanitarian organizations who were in the theater's immediate vicinity sought access to the released hostages but were denied by security officials. When doctors finally did see the hostages, in ambulances or hospitals, medical personnel were unable to prescribe appropriate treatment, as officials had not informed them of the substance that was used.

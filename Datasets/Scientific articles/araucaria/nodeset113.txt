Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today the House will be considering legisla-tion that would allow for the importa-tion of prescription drugs from foreign lands, H.R. 2427. The supporters of this bill will tell us that this legislation will give millions of Americans access to safe, cheap drugs from foreign coun-tries. I believe them to be wrong. In-stead, this bill will only serve to under-cut important safety protections and place foreign price controls on Amer-ican businesses. We are all concerned about the cost of prescription drugs, but this bill is not the way to go about holding down prices. This bill is not about free trade. In other industries, we do not permit the imposition of foreign price controls on American businesses, and we should not in this case, either.

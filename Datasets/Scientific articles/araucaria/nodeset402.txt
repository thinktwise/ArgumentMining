Many Arab and Muslim societies are now moving towards democracy, although this may take some time and the people have to be brought along with it. "It is not a process that can be imposed from above." Civil society is developing, and there are now over 100,000 NGOs in the Arab world, as well as widespread debate about the future conducted through an increasingly outspoken media. Any fair assessment will show that Arab countries are serious about the path on which they have embarked. But assertions from some people in the West that "we are coming to change you" are totally unacceptable. "We all have to work together, as we do at Davos, so that others can all understand what Islam is about, just as we Muslims should learn what Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism are all about. That is the way ahead. [Otherwise] a clash of civilizations will eat us all." http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/A%20Dialogue%20about%20Islam%20and%20Democracy_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

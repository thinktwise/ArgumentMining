The real impact of Labor's win is threefold. Labor no longer needs the independents. Labor no longer needs the Liberals in the Upper House. And Labor no longer needs to worry seriously about losing office next time it faces the voters. For Steve Bracks, this victory is freedom. His government is now free of the constraints under which it operated in its first three years. He can chuck out the P-plates. The car is now his, to drive wherever and however Labor chooses. But freedom is responsibility. It was one thing to support bad ideas such as creating a crime of industrial manslaughter when everyone knew the Liberals would block it in the Upper House. Now the responsibility for deciding what becomes law is solely on Labor itself. The independents were a valuable sounding board for Labor's reform plans. Now it is on its own.

In establishing the stoichiometric, thermochemical, and kinetic relationships [in a biological process used in wastewater treatment DH] it must be remembered that these can be greatly influenced by such environmental variables as temperature, pH, light, ionic environment, etc. The environmental engineering literature should be searched for quantitative values of these relationships; however, it is frequently necessary to resort to experimentation, especially for industrial wastes.

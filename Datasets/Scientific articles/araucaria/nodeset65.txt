There have been no claims of responsibility for the Bali bombings. But some of the methods used in the blasts indicate that they are the work of an international terrorist group, not just local Islamic radicals. For example, the bomb used in the nightclub attack was reportedly made from a military plastic explosive similar to the one used in the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen two years ago.

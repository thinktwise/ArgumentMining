The present prime minister and his finance minister, Jaswant Singh, were in December 1993 the loudest voices demanding ministerial retribution for that JPC report, but have fallen strangely silent over the NDA government, and its agencies and regulators, conniving through the sins of commission and omission detailed in the latest JPC report with the likes of Ketan Parekh and his ilk to milk this nation of thousands upon thousands of crores of the savings of small investors. And this notwithstanding the telling one-line paragraph in the JPC report which lays down that "ministerial responsibility for this report" flows from the same principles adumbrated in the previous JPC report. If no minister is responsible for all that went wrong in our capital markets over the first eighteen months of this government's rule (October 1999 to March 2001, the period of the scam as defined by the JPC) does it mean the liberalisation of the economy has liberated ministers from their responsibility to the country through Parliament? How can those, especially Vajpayee who bayed for blood at the special extended session of Parliament on December 29-30 1993 and then disrupted proceedings for two long weeks from July 27 to August 11 1994, now turn their backs on the principles they so vigorously upheld when they were in Opposition? Especially as no less than seven of the members of the present council of ministers were in 1992-93 members of the previous JPC. Is not what was then sauce for the goose now sauce for the gander?

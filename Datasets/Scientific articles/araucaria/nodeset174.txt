Dr. Curley presents the following argument: 1. Minor sins do not deserve eternal punishment. 2. The Bible teaches that God will eternally punish minor sins. 3. Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist. 9. Now in this argument I think that both of those premises are false. But time only allows me to deal with the second. With regard to the second premise, it is far from obvious that the Bible teaches eternal punishment for minor sins. Rather, what separates us from God forever is the sin of freely rejecting God out of our lives. This is a sin of infinite gravity and proportion, since it is the creature's free decision to reject God Himself. Admittedly, Dr. Curley's Calvinism has no room for this sort of sin. But on a biblical view, it is not so much God, as creatures themselves, who determine their eternal destiny. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html

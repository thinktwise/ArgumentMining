What we really need to do is recall, and totally reconfigure, the state of California. A nation-state like California, with its multilayered government, its myriad boards and commissions, may look like a bureaucratic quagmire to most of us, but to veteran lobbyists, it's a veritable smorgasbord of tax breaks and other perks. Large concentrations of power and money will always attract those who can leverage those resources to their own ends. Tinkering with the existing system - whether it's recalling public officials or passing stricter campaign finance laws - will make no difference as long as there are billions in taxpayer dollars for the taking. What we need to do is downsize state government - make it more accessible to the average citizen while reducing the size of the public trough - by splitting the state into smaller regional units. With a population projected to reach 45 million by 2020, California could easily be split into three or four viable states, each with a distinct regional identity http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/17/IN81189.DTL

The report was commissioned by poker machine operator Tattersalls. Its methodology and the independence of its findings were questioned by InterChurch Gambling Taskforce spokesman Reverend Tim Costello, who said the survey was not reliable because it was based on participants filling out a diary for a fortnight. "People with gambling problems simply don't record their gambling expenditure," he said. He also said that if higher-income earners were really more likely to play on poker machines "there would be as many pokies in Toorak as there are in Footscray".

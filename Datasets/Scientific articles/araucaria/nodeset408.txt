It is obvious that what is happening here is an attempt to discredit Blair and the British Government. I don't believe for one minute that those are really Ken Bigley's words. I do know that if I was taken hostage and given the chance to air my opinion on video; I wouldn't waist my time begging Blair for my life, I would be telling my loved ones how much I love them. The showing of the video is just playing into the hands of the terrorists so they are already getting what they want. This is a terrible situation, there is no doubt about that, but these are terrible people who cannot and should not be bargained with. BC, UK http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3701582.stm

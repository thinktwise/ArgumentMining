Democracy in the Middle East, said Moussa, began to develop in Egypt in the middle of the 19th century, and by the 1940s there were lively parliamentary systems in many Muslim countries, including Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. "This was cut short not by Islam but by politics." After World War II, "the competition between incoming and outgoing empires played havoc in the Arab countries." Military regimes came to power then, often inspired and supported by the Soviet Union. http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/A%20Dialogue%20about%20Islam%20and%20Democracy_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

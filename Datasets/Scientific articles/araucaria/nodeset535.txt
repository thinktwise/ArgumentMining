Ajit Gulabchand, Chairman and Managing Director, Hindustan Construction Company, India, said his firm "operates in a region of the world where earthquakes or damaging floods happen frequently." He reported: "Such catastrophic risks cannot be adequately assessed and are not a line item on a balance sheet. But we can prepare ourselves for such events, for instance by training our people to make sure to have enough medics in the workforce." In the Bophal chemical disaster in India "none of the workers in the plant was killed but 100,000 outside the plant because they were not adequately informed by the company how to protect themselves should a gas accident happen". http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Business%20Interrupted_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament.

Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again -- because we are not dealing with peaceful men. http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_031803.htm

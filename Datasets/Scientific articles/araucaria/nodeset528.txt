The United States helped to rebuild Europe, and parts of Asia, after World War II, after the Korean War. We ve always gone through rough patches in the aftermath of these struggles. We ve made mistakes, but we always succeeded. We always kept on track. We succeeded because America has an enormous capacity to do good; an enormous capacity to learn from its mistakes, and to move on. http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Remarks+by+US+Secretary+of+State+Colin+Powell

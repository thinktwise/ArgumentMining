Foreigners have no place in Iraq. There is no reason for the contractors to be there at all. It blows my mind. The question we should all be asking is why they are there at all? Why are the people of Iraq not rebuilding Iraq? They are unemployed, poverty stricken and destitute. Why are they not given jobs in rebuilding their own country? The people of Iraq should be given the jobs as phone repair, sewer maintenance, road builders, etc. Sandra, Niagara Falls, Canada http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3691548.stm

Yet, if the carriers are not built and properly equipped, a shadow will fall over the whole of Britain's defence capability. It will not only be the Royal Navy that will be threatened with descent into decline. It will be the Army and the Royal Air Force as well.   First, the Services' ability to mount independent operations will be compromised. The Army will not be able to undertake missions at a distance from the home base, because it will not have the air cover essential to its operability. The same goes for the Royal Air Force. It cannot acquire land bases from which to operate outside the home area unless the Navy can provide cover while it does so.   Second, Britain's military standing with America, currently so high, will suffer unless it can maintain some sort of equivalence with the American military machine, now so preponderant.  The Pentagon, while expressing its appreciation of British combat skills, already qualifies its admiration. The British forces, it says, compensate for technical deficiencies by human achievement. It is likely to become less complimentary if Britain falls technically further behind.   Finally, to touch a matter close to the Prime Minister's heart, Britain is at present enjoying an artificial military superiority over its European partners. The bigger EU states - France, Italy, Spain and now Germany - are professionalising their armed forces. They are also bracing themselves to accept higher levels of defence spending.

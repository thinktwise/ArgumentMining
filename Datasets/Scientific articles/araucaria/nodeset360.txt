Would they claim, perhaps, that a treaty which is unfavourable to our city is binding, and yet refuse to recognize it if it gives us any guarantees? Do you find this just? What? If a clause of the treaty is favourable to our enemies but unfavourable to us, they insists that it is valid; but if, on the contrary, they find in it a clause which is just and advantageous for us and disadvantageous for them, they think they must oppose it vigorously.

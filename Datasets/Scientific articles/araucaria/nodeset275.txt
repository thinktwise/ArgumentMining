Dr. Curley gives the following argument: 1. Infants are damned because of original sin. 2. The Bible teaches original sin. 3. Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist. 11. I dispute the first premise. In fact, I challenge Dr. Curley to read me a single passage of Scripture that teaches that infants are damned because of original sin. The Bible teaches no such thing. On the contrary, Jesus took up the little children in his arms and blessed them, saying "Let the little children come to me... for such is the kingdom of heaven" (Mark 10.14). http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html

Most of the nearly 200 people killed and hundreds others injured on Saturday were foreign tourists, but Indonesia has been badly hurt as well. Its sense of security has been jolted, its stock market is reeling and Bali's economically important tourist industry faces ruinous free fall. This was the latest and deadliest of several recent assaults. Together they offer evidence that Al Qaeda and its allies have survived the war in Afghanistan and are regrouping to organize new strikes. Two weeks ago Kuwaiti terrorists opened fire on American marines in the country for joint exercises with the Kuwaiti military, killing one of them. One of the assailants left behind a tape pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Yesterday more gunfire was directed at American troops in Kuwait. Late last month a French oil tanker was set ablaze off Yemen in what Paris believes was a terrorist attack. Meanwhile a new tape by Osama bin Laden's top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has begun circulating. American authorities believe it was recorded recently.

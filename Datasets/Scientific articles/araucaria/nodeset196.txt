Of course, giving more power to patients will mean giving the most power to articulate, well-informed and pushy patients, who tend to be better-off. No health-care system can hope to be perfectly egalitarian, but patient power should drive up standards for everyone; keeping power in the hands of doctors and bureaucrats, on the other hand, will keep standards low while being just as unequal. Nor is it safe to assume that, because the poor are less well- informed, it is in their interest that all the important decisions about their care should be made for them.

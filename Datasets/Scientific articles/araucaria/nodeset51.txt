It is well established that if any statement is made on the floor of the House by a Member or Minister which another Member believes to be untrue, incomplete or incorrect, it does not constitute a breach of privilege.  In order to constitute a breach of privilege or contempt of the House, it has to be proved that the statement was not only wrong or misleading but it was made deliberately to mislead the House.  A breach of privilege can arise only when the Member or the Minister makes a false statement or an incorrect statement wilfully, deliberately and knowingly.    On a perusal of the comments of the Ministers in the matter, I am satisfied that there has been no misleading of the House by them as alleged by the Member.   I have accordingly disallowed the notice of question of privilege.  Copies of the comments of the Ministers have already been made available to Dr. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.

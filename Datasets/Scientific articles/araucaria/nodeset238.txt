It was August 1955, the day of Eisenhower s return from the Geneva summit meeting, a chill, rainy afternoon at Washington National Airport as the Vice-President and leading officials gathered to welcome the President home. Many carried umbrellas, but what gave the scene a bizarre aspect was that none of the umbrellas was raised. The dignitaries huddled in the open, wet and bedraggled, because the Vice-President had given the 16 order no umbrellas! In Nixon s mind, this order was necessary for propaganda reasons. At that moment it was still not clear whether Geneva had been a triumph or a setback for the West; and for lack of a better estimate of the situation, there were uncomfortable reminders of Neville Chamberlain and Munich. The umbrella had been Chamberlain s trademark and the emblem of his appeasement policy. Nixon wanted no such untoward symbol. (Costello 1960, 266)

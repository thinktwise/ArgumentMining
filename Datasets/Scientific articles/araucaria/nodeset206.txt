That's a harsh judgment, but success will depend on a long series of conditions. First, the U.S. and its allies have to win the war against Iraq -- assuming it is fought -- and do it quickly. A stalemate, or even "peaceful regime change," would undermine the U.S. ability to shape political outcomes in Iraq, the first domino in the Bush vision.   There is little doubt that the Iraq could withstand the U.S. assault, but the U.S. has to win an overwhelming victory, one that ends completely the current Baghdad regime. Only then will Washington have the free hand it wants to remake Iraq as well as the leverage with other governments in the region.

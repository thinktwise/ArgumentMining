Moral evil should be admitted or permitted only insofar as it is regarded as the necessary consequence of an indispensable duty, in circumstances such that the person who would like to prevent another s sin would fail in his own duty if he did; as if an officer with the duty of guarding an important post were to leave it, particularly at a time of danger, in order to stop a quarrel in the town between two soldiers of the garrison who were on the point of killing one other.

Approaching the matter in that way, I am satisfied that the present is not a very exceptional case of that kind. The claimants have published articles supporting a transition to a republic and, even though Mr Rusbridger specifically drew the articles to the attention of the Attorney-General, they have not been prosecuted. They want to publish similar articles in the future and, if they do so, they will not be prosecuted then either. Their decisions as to whether or not to publish such articles are not affected in any way by the existence of section 3. The issue of the compatibility or incompatibility of that section with article 10 is therefore moot so far as the claimants are concerned.

It's the old Orissa drought and starvation story being played out again. This time in Rajasthan. Even as the casualties mount, the state and central governments would like the world to believe that the deaths were caused by disease and lack of hygiene rather than by abject poverty and starvation. But for anyone who visits Rajasthan's Baran district, the apathy of the district administration and the failure of the Public Distribution System (pds) is clear to see. Whatever spin you give it, it is hunger that is claiming its victims.

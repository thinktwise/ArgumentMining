When, on Sunday, December 17, 1967, the prime minister of Australia dived into the surf at Cheviot Beach near Portsea, never to be seen again, it was little wonder that his disappearance assumed an almost surreal quality. Even so, the mystery surrounding the death of Harold Holt is largely in the minds of those who dwell on such things. What is known for certain is that Mr Holt, 59, entered the water voluntarily after declaring to "know this beach like the back of my hand". It was likely this bravado, combined with lack of fitness and a boiling surf, claimed his life. That and his own belief in the image he had cultivated.

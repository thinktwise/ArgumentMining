Richard A. Jefferson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, CAMBIA, Australia, a Social Entrepreneur, develops policies and technologies that enable many new and low-margin applications. "It is a process for the democratization of innovation," he said, noting that farming represents such a technology. There are parallels between open source software and all levels of the innovative process, he commented.

"They are the owners of skills like animal husbandry, bee keeping or farming," he remarked. "The key is human creativity, and using technology and wise policy to nurture the innate problem-solving capacity within all people." Owners have no motivation to corrupt, he added.

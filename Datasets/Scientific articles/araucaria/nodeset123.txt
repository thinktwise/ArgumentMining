But the public has never been allowed in jury rooms, and with good reason. Jurors are not government officials, and do not perform a representational function. Being a juror is more akin to voting, a civic duty that occurs in private. Like voters in an exit poll, jurors ought to be free to speak afterward about their deliberations, but they are not obligated to. Televising jury deliberations will skew the composition of juries by removing people who do not want to reach a verdict - and in this case, possibly impose the death penalty - on a public stage. So far at least 14 out of 110 prospective jurors in Mr. Harrison's case have been excused for reasons related to the presence of cameras. These jurors may be precisely the ones best suited to serve. Allowing cameras in the jury room would also harm the deliberative process. Jurors, especially less educated and articulate ones, may be wary of speaking out if they know they are being judged by an audience at home. They may be more reluctant to question the credibility of a witness, or to take an unpopular stand, like holding out for an acquittal, or against the death penalty. It is no answer that, at least in this case, the defendant's lawyers have agreed to the process. A defendant's lawyers cannot waive his right to a trial that conforms with the Constitution. And in any case, society as a whole has an interest in the justice system operating fairly.

The Minister is aware that the haddock permit management scheme has had very severe consequences for the Shetland white fish fleet in particular. Does he accept that, if that is rolled over for the beginning of 2005, there is a risk that that will lead to the substantial dumping of haddock surely something that no one wants? Will he make the removal of that scheme one of his main priorities at November's discussions? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm041021/debtext/41021-05.htm

This madness has to stop, and the fastest way of doing that is to elect John Kerry, not because he will be different but because in most key areas Iraq, the "war on drugs," Israel/Palestine, free trade, corporate taxes he will be just as bad. The main difference will be that as Kerry pursues these brutal policies, he will come off as intelligent, sane and blissfully dull. That's why I've joined the Anybody But Bush camp: Only with a bore like Kerry at the helm will we finally be able to put an end to the presidential pathologizing and focus on the issues again. http://www.why-war.com/news/2004/08/16/ditchthe.html

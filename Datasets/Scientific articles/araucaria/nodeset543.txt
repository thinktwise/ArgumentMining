Here Dr. Curley's argument seems to go something like this:    1.  God exists.    2.  If God is all powerful, He can create any world that He wants.    3.  If God is all good, than He would create a world without evil.    4)  Therefore, evil should not exist.    But, evil does exist.  So it follows, therefore, that God does not exist.    16. Now the problem with this argument is that Dr. Curley hasn't shown either of the two crucial premises to be necessarily true.  Take premise (2), that an all powerful God can create any world that He wants.  If God wills to create free creatures, then it's logically impossible for Him to make them freely do what He wants.  So Dr. Curley would have to show that there is a world of free creatures, which God could create, which has as much good as this world, but which has less evil.  But how could he possibly prove such a thing?  It is pure speculation.    17. What about premise (3), that an all loving God would prefer a world without evil. Now that premise might be true if God's purpose were to create a comfortable environment for His human pets.  But on the Christian view, we are not God's pets.  And the purpose of life is not happiness, as such, but rather the knowledge of God and His salvation  which will ultimately bring true happiness.  But many evils occur in life which are utterly pointless with respect to producing human happiness.  But they may not be pointless with respect to producing a deeper knowledge of God.  Dr. Curley would have to prove that there is another world that God could have created with this much knowledge of God and His salvation but with less evils.  But how could anyone prove such a thing?  Again, it is pure speculation.  And, therefore, the problem of evil, I think, is simply inconclusive and doesn't disprove Christian theism

Sky News correspondent Jeff Reed rose after one of those military briefings in Doha to ask: "Can I ask the daily weapons of mass destruction question? They haven't been deployed. They haven't been discovered. Is this war going to make history by being ended before you've found its cause?" After a significant pause, Maj Gen Victor Renuart replied, "That's a great question. We continue to look at sites around the country." That was two weeks ago. That question is asked again by the enduring image of the war-the 12-year-old boy Ali Ismail Abbas who lost both his arms, and both his parents, to a US bomb. If Renuart still can't answer Reed's question, why did Ali lose his arms? If the wmds are found, questions would still arise over the bombing of civilians-mostly children-because 60 per cent of Iraq's 24 million are children. If not, the very act of war would be illegal, and Saddam's reign of brutality glossed by his one truth: that Iraq possessed no wmd. Saddam was as bad a guy as one can get, but there is no law-national or international-that sanctions attacks on guys because you have good reason to believe they are bad, and could threaten you (see infographic). Says jurist Fali S. Nariman, "There is no international law justifying a state taking pre-emptive military action against another state where the doctrine of necessity would not so warrant. A state's claim for self-defence does not justify military action against another state that has not attempted or threatened an attack on it."

Here Dr. Curley's argument seems to go like this: 1. The Bible teaches that God gives justifying faith to those He arbitrarily chooses and excludes others. 2. It is unfair to do this. 3. Therefore, the God of the Bible does not exist. 13. I think the first premise is false. Nowhere does the New Testament teach that justifying faith is arbitrarily bestowed by God. Rather, justification by faith is the wonderful doctrine that God's forgiveness and salvation is a free gift that you can't do anything to merit. This is a wonderful doctrine because it gets us off the treadmill of trying to earn favor with God and trying to merit salvation. All we have to do is freely place our trust in Him. God, therefore, excludes no one. Jesus said, "Whosoever will, may come" (John 7.37). But some people freely exclude God from their lives. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html But are the premises, in fact, true? Well, I think not. First, it is not the case that God is liable to command anything. God's commands flow necessarily from His own nature and character, which is essentially loving, holy, compassionate, just, and so forth. And thus, His commands are not arbitrary, but reflect God's own morally perfect nature. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html

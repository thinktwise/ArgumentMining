All non-military personnel taking assignments in Iraq should be implanted with GPS tracking devices. These devices need to have a pressure sensitive "panic mode" that would activate a signal similar to an EPIRB on marine vessels. Hopefully, this would make potential hostages less attractive if the terrorists knew there was a strong likelihood of their being brought to justice.

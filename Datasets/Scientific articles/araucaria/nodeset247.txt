Our problems, however, are not so much with printing the material as with distributing it. Every so often a large group of distributors gets caught. The head of the distribution network, who had contacts with the majority of drop-off points, was arrested just a few months into the war. They had been observing him for a while, checking out his routes, and then they grabbed him and a few others. A group arrest of distributors is always a big blow, since rebuilding such a network requires long and tedious work. Moreover, while at the beginning of martial law we literally had crowds of people clamouring to be distributors, over time this began to come to a halt. If you put something in someone s hands, they d still pass it along, but people stopped coming to us on their own. The optimal solution was to cut back the numbers of Tygodnik Mazowsze we printed at the center, while at the same time producing stencils that local union groups could use to make their own copies of the journal.

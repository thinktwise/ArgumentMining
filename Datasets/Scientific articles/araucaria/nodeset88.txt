The notion that there is a media vendetta to prove that black people are inherently corrupt is fallacious. The simple fact is that this country is run by a black government and the upper rungs of public service are mainly peopled by blacks. And another truth beyond doubt is that the same government runs one of the more competent and forward-looking administrations on the planet. It is, therefore, demographically logical that its successes are directly attributable to black people at the helm. And it is also demographically logical that when wrongdoing takes place in the ranks of government, the probabilities are that it will be the black people running the show who will be fingered. That is simple logic.

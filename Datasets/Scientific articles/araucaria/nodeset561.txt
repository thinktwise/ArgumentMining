It seems that the money is used to foster development of off-shore drilling, development of hydro-electric plants, and a road into the heart of the Amazon. This last one, the road into the Amazon will likely result in commercialization and destruction of the valuable Amazon habitat, regardless of how careful the plans. It is similar to allowing drilling in ANWR! In a way, then the world bank is loaning Brazil money which will ultimately result in environmental destruction in the name of environmental and economic progress http://www.theenvironmentsite.org/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=436

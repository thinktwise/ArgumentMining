I am told that net farm income for hill farmers in the less favoured areas is some 12,000 a year, and one cannot easily keep body and soul together on such an income. What are the Government doing to boost the incomes of people on the hills who look after our famous landscapes in, for example, the Pennines? What steps are the Government taking to encourage young people into hill farming, given that the average age of hill farmers is close to 60? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm041021/debtext/41021-05.htm

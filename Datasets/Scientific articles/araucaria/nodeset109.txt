Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am sincerely disappointed about the placing of an anonymous hold on S. 2043, the ``Veterans Long-Term Care and Medical Programs Enhancement Act of 2002.'' There is no apparent reason why this important piece of legislation should be held up at this time. It was developed in a bipartisan manner and encompasses many vital pieces of legislation from both sides of the aisle.

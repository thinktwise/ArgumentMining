Was the timing intended? It would be difficult to say. Was the blast meant to intimidate the judges trying the cases arising from the Bali explosion not to pronounce a guilty verdict. Though acts of terrorism meant to intimidate the judiciary are not uncommon in India, the Jakarta blast, which was directed at the American-owned Marriot Hotel, does not appear to have been meant to warn the Indonesian judiciary. If they had wanted to convey a warning to the judiciary, they would have chosen as their target a building associated with the judiciary or at least the government.

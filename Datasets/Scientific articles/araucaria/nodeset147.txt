Look at the figures: 121 Labour MPs, 13 Tories (including Mr Clarke) and 52 Liberal Democrats voted for an amendment declaring the case against Saddam Hussein as yet unproven. A total of 199 MPs voted against early military action, while 393 voted for war. But if fewer than 100 of the 125 Tories who backed Mr Blair had instead voted with Mr Clarke, the Prime Minister would have lost.  So the Tories, amazingly, can still make a difference.

The Bowers Court 's ini- tial substantive statement -"The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy ...," 478 U..S.,at 190 -discloses the Court 's failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward,just as it would demean a married couple were it said that marriage is just about the right to have sexual intercourse.Although the laws in- volved in Bowers and here purport to do not more than prohibit a particular sexual act,their penalties and purposes have more far- reaching consequences,touching upon the most private human con- duct,sexual behavior,and in the most private of places,the home. They seek to control a personal relationship that,whether or not en- titled to formal recognition in the law,is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to choose to enter upon relationships in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.Pp.3 -6.

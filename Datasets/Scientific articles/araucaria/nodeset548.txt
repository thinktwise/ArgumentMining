Werner G. Seifert, Chief Executive Officer, Deutsche B rse, Germany, argued that divergences between stock prices and traditional measures of fundamental value such as price-to-earnings or price-to-book were not necessarily a market imperfection. The extremes of the Internet bubble, in which some popular stocks traded at prices that implied unrealistic rates of growth maintained in perpetuity, were examples of what he called "disproductive disconnects" produced by irrational investor behaviour. However, he cited examples of "productive disconnects" in which stocks have been richly or inexpensively valued for other reasons such as presence or absence of political risk. The correctness of these judgements can only be seen in hindsight.

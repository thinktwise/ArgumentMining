Consider the Vajpayee government today. A BJP prime minister, a BJP deputy prime minister in charge of home, a BJP minister of finance, external affairs, HRD, information and broadcasting, health, commerce and industries, petroleum, rural development, civil aviation, surface transport, law. Now add agriculture. And they still call this a National Democratic Alliance government?

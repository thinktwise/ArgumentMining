Robert Doyle is clearly the underdog and it is going to be a very tough fight but "I will give him all the help he asks for", the PM declared from Alice Springs on Monday. For Howard, Victoria is a no-lose situation. Doyle is not expected to win, so his defeat would be no skin off the prime ministerial nose. But if Doyle did better than expected, Howard, who is soaring high, would receive some credit.

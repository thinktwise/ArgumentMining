We don t know what types of medicines the Mentawai have made. Perhaps their medicines are more efficient than ours. Why should we assume that modern medicine would cure them? Perhaps they do not wish or need to be cured. Also, we do not know what the effect of modern medicine on their culture will be. If in fact the population grows, more resources will be needed from the rainforest. With the government threatening to take control of the land and take resources, raising the population could be detrimental to all of their lives. http://www.teachtsp2.com/cdonline/

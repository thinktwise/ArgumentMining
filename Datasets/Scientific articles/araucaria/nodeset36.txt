At the beginning of the story Ms Mulkerrins owned a freehold property where she ran a small but profitable business as the proprietor of a nursing home. She faced the prospect of bankruptcy as a result of the failure of a business which she and her husband had formerly carried on together. The situation was tailor-made for an individual voluntary arrangement ("IVA"). Bankruptcy would destroy the business and yield relatively little for the creditors. An IVA, on the other hand, would preserve the business and enable the creditors to receive payments from the income of the nursing home.

As an Iraqi, I feel disgust and shame that such atrocities are carried out in my country. Iraqis are as much victims of these crimes as the foreigners who are trying to help Iraqis in reconstruction and humanitarian work. Very little coverage given to those Iraqis kidnapped for ransom or revenge. I put the blame completely on the US and British troops for not having a proper plan for the "morning after" the invasion, and the chaos that ensued. The borders are wide open to infiltrators, the country is awash with weapons of all types, and the streets are swarming with criminals and ex-Saddam loyalists. The focus should be on the overall picture (of mayhem and murder) rather than on one event (a kidnapping). The apparent current policy of waiting and seeing must change. Tony Blair and George Bush and the rest of the allied countries must inject massive resources and personnel immediately to deal with this. Secure the borders, round up the criminals, curfews, road blocks and checkpoints, and properly train and equip the new Iraqi army and police force. Be seen to care about the mess they have created.

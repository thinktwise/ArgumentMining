Mr Howard hit a personal note as he described how his mother-in-law had died from a hospital-acquired infection and how his grandmother had been killed in a Nazi concentration camp.

I want to give Britain just a tiny bit back for what Britain has given me." http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3714812.stm

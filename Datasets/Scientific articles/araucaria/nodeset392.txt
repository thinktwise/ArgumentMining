My hon. Friend may be interested to know that I am in the process of establishing a new all-party group on conflict management and resolution. Does he agree that the lesson of Northern Ireland is that peace helps to generate trade and industry and that trade and industry help to generate peace? Is not that transferable to a new and enlivened peace process in Israel and Palestine? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm040916/debtext/40916-03.htm#40916-03_wqn0

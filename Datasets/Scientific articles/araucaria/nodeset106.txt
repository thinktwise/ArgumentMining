California's law extends  the time in which prosecution is allowed,authorizes prosecutions  that the passage of time has previously barred,and was enacted after  prior limitations periods for Stogner' s alleged offenses had expired.  Such features produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution  forbids.First,the law threatens the kinds of harm that the Clause  seeks to avoid,for the Clause protects liberty by preventing govern-  ments from enacting statutes with "manifestly unjust and oppressive"  retroactive effects.Calder v.Bull,3 Dall.386,391.Second,the law  falls literally within the categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws  that Justice Chase set forth more than 200 years ago in Calder v.  Bull,which this Court has recognized as an authoritative account of  the Clause's scope,Collins v.Youngblood,497 U.S.37,46.It falls  within the second category,which Justice Chase understood to in-  clude a new law that inflicts punishments where the party was not,  by law,liable to any punishment.Third,numerous legislators,  courts,and commentators have long believed it well settled that the  Clause forbids resurrection of a time-barred prosecution.The Recon-  struction Congress of 1867 rejected a bill that would have revived  time-barred treason prosecutions against Jefferson Davis and others,  passing instead a law extending unexpired limitations periods.  Roughly contemporaneous State Supreme Courts echoed the view  that laws reviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto.Even  courts that have upheld extensions of unexpired statutes of limita-  tions have consistently distinguished situations where the periods  have expired ,often using language that suggests a presumption that  reviving time-barred criminal cases is not allowed.

My hon. Friend will be aware of the recent Environment Agency report showing from research that within a radius of 2 km from a hazardous waste site, recorded birth defects are 7 per cent. higher than in the rest of the population. I have some personal interest in that question, as I live within 1 km of such a site. What is the Department doing to research that and to find out what the direct link is, and what joint work is being done by his Department and the Department of Health to ensure that people are protected? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm041021/debtext/41021-03.htm

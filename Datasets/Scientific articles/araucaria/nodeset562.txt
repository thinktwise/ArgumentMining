I think the expansion of the EU is playing a part here. New countries joining the EU have been operating with low environmental protection standards and it is not reasonable to expect them to bring their standards up to scratch quickly because of their (often damaged by bad government) poor infrastructures. So the figures may get worse before they get better http://www.theenvironmentsite.org/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=177

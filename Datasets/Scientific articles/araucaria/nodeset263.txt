 For  example, just last week the subject of  Thursday's hearing in the Committee  on Armed Services was a proposal from  the administration to exempt the Department  of Defense from five key environmental  laws from the Clean Air  Act to the Endangered Species Act.  These laws not only protect endangered  species and eco-systems, they  protect the health of people living on  and around military bases. If the exemptions  were granted, American tax-payers  and State and local governments  would bear the burden of clean-up  costs and face public health risks  from toxic contamination resulting  from military operations. The evidence  shows there is no reasonable case for  such exemptions. The environmental  laws already allow the Department of  Defense to apply for exemptions on a  case-by-case basis if they really need  it. Both the GAO and EPA Administrator Whitman have testified that environmental  laws have not affected  military readiness. There is no evidence  that the military has ever been  refused an exemption from laws that  were necessary and that they sought it.

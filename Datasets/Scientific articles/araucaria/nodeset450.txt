I am really surprised by some people's comments here. Why are we not looking for the real reasons behind what's going on? Was there any beheading and hostage taking before the US-UK invasion for Iraq? I do not support the killing of any innocent people, but what would every one of you do if your country was invaded, your people were killed daily by the hundreds and nobody even bothered to count your dead innocent people? And why is it that when foreign citizens are killed in Iraq, it affects the reputation of Muslims, when the soldiers killing innocent Iraqis aren't hurting the reputation of Christianity? Why such double standards? Redar Hawleri, Erbil (Kurdistan-Iraq) http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3691548.stm

One day in the street I met the translator of my articles. He was talking to a man with a full beard, and when I nodded and started to pass on, he stopped me. You must want to get chased out of Guatemala, he said, by writing such an article as the one about the Monroe Doctrine. We had a lot of trouble with it. What was wrong? I asked. The answer came from the man with the beard. It was too strong, he said. You can t print some of the things you wanted to say. Calling the President of the United States the sluggish-minded James Monroe. You will have the American Minister down on you. (Batson 1931, 181)

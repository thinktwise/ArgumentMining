Accusing the Palestinians of irresponsibility ignores the essential character of the conflict, responded Aaron D. Miller, President, Seeds of Peace, USA. Israel exercises the power of the strong, sometimes in legitimate self-defence, sometimes in illegitimate ways through settlement activity, for example. The Palestinians, on the other hand, rely on the power of the weak, which is based on the belief that the occupation relieves them of responsibility to combat terrorism. This fundamental asymmetry, Miller added, makes it impossible for Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate a solution without US aid. "I m well aware of the contradictions and inconsistencies of American foreign policy," Miller said. "But I m still convinced there will be no solution without a 24/7 approach to conflict resolution by the United States." http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Is%20There%20a%20Coherent%20US%20Foreign%20Policy%20for%20the%20Middle%20East%3F_2004?open&event_id=1185&year_id=2004

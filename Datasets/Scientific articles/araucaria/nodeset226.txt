Confronting Australian demands for tougher sanctions, the African troika members responded that Zimbabwe's 12-month suspension from the Commonwealth had not run its course and more time was needed for diplomacy to bear fruit. Plausible enough -- if there had there been some progress in the six months since the Marlborough House demands: dialogue between Zanu-PF and the opposition, engagement with the Commonwealth on electoral changes, and involvement of the Commonwealth and the United Nations in land reform. Nothing has happened on any of these fronts, as President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo conceded to the world's media after the Abuja meeting. Nor could they offer a convincing reason for believing another six months of diplomacy will make a difference.

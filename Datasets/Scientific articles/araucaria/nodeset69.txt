President Roh, the first South Korean president born after the end of World War II, has no direct experience of Japan's 1910-1945 colonization of Korea. At a postsummit press conference, he said, encouragingly, that he wants to avoid the issue of "history" -- Japan's militaristic past -- and that the two nations should make joint efforts to create a better future. The Japanese people need to take that statement humbly, for there are still many people, including politicians, who seem to glorify or whitewash some of our nation's misdeeds. The latest example is a remark by the policy chief of the Liberal Democratic Party that tried to justify Japan's colonial policy of forcing Koreans to take Japanese surnames. Mutual confidence, not narrow nationalism, is what the two nations need most as they look to the future.

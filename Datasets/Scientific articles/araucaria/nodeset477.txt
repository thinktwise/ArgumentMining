Marilyn C. Nelson, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Carlson Companies, USA, noted that one major stakeholder voice not fully heard at the table is the voice of women. Nelson pointed out that 80% of the consumption in the US is determined by women. By not listening, corporations risk losing touch with the consumer. In a worldwide battle for talent, not utilizing women to the fullest is a mistake, and empowering women in developing countries is four times as likely to improve health benefits for children.

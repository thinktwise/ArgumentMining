However, if India's rate of infection were to rise to a mere in comparative terms 5 per cent., not only would millions more Indians be condemned to death, but so could millions of their neighbours. India's population alone is far bigger than Africa's. If the disease were to spread to Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, we would face a regional epidemic affecting more than a quarter of those alive in the world today. Surely that means to be fair, I think the Secretary of State said this that although Africa is the worst affected area at the moment, and thus the natural primary focus of our efforts, there is compelling evidence that future programmes must be designed to arrest a potential massive explosion of HIV/AIDS elsewhere as well. http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm040916/debtext/40916-16.htm

Two post offices in my constituency closed even though Postwatch objected and supported the campaign against closure. On appeal, the Post Office decided to go ahead with the closures. Does that not show that Postwatch is a toothless tiger? Is it not about time that it was given powers to ensure that it can overrule the Post Office when it has serious objections to a closure? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm040916/debtext/40916-02.htm#40916-02_wqn0

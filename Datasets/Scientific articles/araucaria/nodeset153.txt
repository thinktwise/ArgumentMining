I have been voting since 1964 and at one time worked for my chosen party. I have always believed it is my duty to vote and have rarely missed the opportunity to do so. On this occasion, however, I shall not vote for any individual or party but will spoil my paper. Why? I believe nationally this government holds us in contempt, and locally I have received no information at all on any of the candidates so it appears they don't much care either. Barbara, UK

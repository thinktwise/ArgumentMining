Incoming EU Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso refused on Thursday to bow to socialist demands to ditch justice chief Rocco Buttiglione after the Italian apologised for calling homosexuality a sin.

They have said they would vote against Barroso's entire commission team at a vote next Wednesday if he does not. http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/21/italy.eu.reut/index.html

Mr. President, many Senators feel that they are under great pressure Do those who believe that the Presi-dent- whatever party he is, Democrat or Republican-do those who believe that he is king under our Constitu-tion- apparently some Senators here vote as though they think the Presi-dent is king, although they know bet-ter than that. But still they believe they have to follow the President's di-rection. The President did not bring any of us here. The President did not elect any of the Members of this body. This is an independent body. This is an inde-pendent branch of Government. This is a separate branch of Government. No President elects any Member of this body. The President is just the Chief Executive of the land. I say ''just.'' It is a tremendous office, of course, with great power, but he is no king. And we are not sent here by our people to let the President or the White House or any party control us or dictate to us.

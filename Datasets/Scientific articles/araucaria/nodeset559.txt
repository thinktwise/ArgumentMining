The above is really some background first off. There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol. Prior to having a problem I was a UK highly respected IT Consultant and was very successful. However when the problem took hold, the demise to my job and my health also began. Since getting over it nearly a year and a half ago now I had to decide what to do. My health had suffered to the point where any job that I used to do was impossible as I am not allowed to drive due to seizures. But like I said 2 reasons. The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money (cant live on freah air) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive. The second reason is a little deeper. I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference. http://www.theforumzone.com/forums/showthread.php?s=10b5359bd78bcd47e2db03fb46e6ea42&t=576

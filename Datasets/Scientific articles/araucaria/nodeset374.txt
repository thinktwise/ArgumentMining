You are treating me, father, more harshly than I deserve. Indeed, if you consider Chresphontes to be an evil man, why did you give him to me as a husband? If, on the other hand, he is a good man, why did you force me, against my will and his, to leave him? C. Perelman, L. Olbrechts-Tyteca The New Rhetoric, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 1971, p.238

The DPJ crisis is also likely to have an effect on other opposition parties, for the public's disappointment with the DPJ will lead to an erosion of confidence in the opposition camp as a whole. A weakening of opposition ranks, already evident in the Diet and elsewhere, will further embolden the ruling parties. As a result, politics may lose some of its vital flexibility to the detriment of sound parliamentary democracy in Japan. That is why the DPJ should consider the Hatoyama resignation in the broader context of a political reorganization. The election of a new leadership must be the first step in this process. Discussion of more detailed and more credible plans for promoting opposition unity is needed. For a start, the party should account for its stunning setbacks in October's parliamentary by-elections. A candid analysis of its mistakes is essential to its revival.

You want a cure for most "depression" case here is what you do. First, realize that depression is a feeling and there are other feelings. Second, there are a very few that have depression so great as to override other feelings like hunger and warmth. Third, take the kid 20 miles into the woods with a map, compass, and trail markers and tell that kid to walk due east to a camp with food, shelter, and a two way radio. Fourth, go home and wait for the call. It will probably take at least two days because the kid won't think your serious. But when that belly rumbles and a chill creeps up, there will be no more depression. That need to survive will kick in and that will be it.

I recently came across a copy of "Seapower," the official magazine of the Navy League -- the Navy, Marines, Coast Guard and the Merchant Marine. The list of "corporate sponsors" include (among its "Gold Medal members") Lockheed-Martin, Rockwell, General Dynamics, Grumman, GE, etc., with glossy full-page ads advertising their latest cutting-edge developments. In fact, these corporate sponsors are the *only* advertisers in the magazine. The articles themselves make repeated references to the technological developments of these corporations. In other words, it is hardly more than a business magazine by and for the defense industry.

n 1922, the River Rouge Ry. [Railway DH] Co. [Company DH] made an offer of sale of its St. Remi extension to the Canadian National Ry. Co., successor to the Canadian Northern Quebec Ry. Co., but the offer was refused. It was felt that the extension of the National Ry. to St. Remi was not justified at the moment, and, also that the River Rouge Ry. Co. had not been ethical in its attempts to secure a subsidy.

But the truth appears to be far more mundane. Multiple Wits sources of varied ideological and other hues say that signs emerged very early in Reid Birley's tenure that she was extraordinarily difficult to work with and that the unanimous initial goodwill towards her steadily dissipated among those who had to interact with her daily. We report this week that senior Wits academics, whom we name with their permission and whose own transformation and gender credentials are impeccable, despairingly recount that Reid Birley repeatedly rejected long-term attempts at constructive intervention. It is also a matter of record that two very senior managers, recruited from an historically disadvantaged university and who can scarcely be said to be anti-transformation reactionaries, have distanced themselves from Reid Birley. With such considerations in mind, it is difficult to understand Reid Birley's claims that allegations against her are without substance. Clearly, a crisis had been building up for many months; equally clearly, Wits needed to act urgently to resolve it.

My heart goes out to Ken Bigley for every day, hour, minute, second he is suffering. I just pray that the hostage-takers are treating him with respect (as far as possible). These videos MUST be shown. It is the only way to provoke debate that is essential to maintain any democracy. I understand Mr Blair's dilemma, but can't get past the feeling that there has to be something that can be done to save this poor soul.

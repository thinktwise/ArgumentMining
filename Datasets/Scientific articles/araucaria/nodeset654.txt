For as long as the Borgons are our enemy, we should encourage our children to play violent video games because encouraging our children to play violent video games will help desensitize them enough that they will not be squeamish about fighting computerized wars in the future. Our best cognitive psychologists have shown that children who have been exposed to violence on screen are less likely to resist fighting wars when they are adults. We need our children to continue this war because the Borgons are training their children to fight us as well.

I'm always curious as to why people decided to start a forum. It seems that everyone has their own reason(s). I started this forum so I could help others, and learn more about forums from other people. I think forums are a great way to communicate online, and love the fact that I can with people of all different experience levels from all around the world. Forums have been a hobby of mine for a long time, and I've learned a lot along the way. My hope for this forum is that people can learn from the mistakes others have made and save themselves from experiencing some of the same growing pains. http://www.theforumzone.com/forums/showthread.php?s=10b5359bd78bcd47e2db03fb46e6ea42&t=576

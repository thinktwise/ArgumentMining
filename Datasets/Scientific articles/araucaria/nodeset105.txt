QUESTION:Can we go back to your statement?As I --as I understood it,it wasn't the omission of Fox, but the addition of your people.In other words,it wasn't the failure to give credit to respondents,but it was petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the lower courts thought was wrong. MR.GERBER:Taking the lower courts in ascending order,on page 53a of the cert petition,the language is that the court finds that defendant's failure to identify the television series and the book is misleading to the public.And then at the Ninth Circuit level,on page 3a of the petition,the language is that Dastar copied,et cetera,and marketed it without attribution to Fox. Neither court,Justice Ginsburg,examined Dastar's credits,affirmative credits,for accuracy,for whether they registered with the consumers,for misleadingness or falsity in any way.I would suggest that the record indeed is that it was the omission of credits for their competitors that was,in fact,the basis for the double award. QUESTION:This is a failure --this is a failure to attribute case then? MR.GERBER:Yes,it is,Your Honor. Our first and most sweeping point -- QUESTION:But may I just point out on 3a,it -- the quote --you left out the first clause I think. They --they labeled the --the resulting product with a different name and marketed it without attribution. MR.GERBER:Oh,yes.That's a reference to changing the title of the work.The entire phrase --and pardon my truncation of it --on page 3a is that Dastar copied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series created by Twentieth Century Fox,labeled the resulting product with a different name,and marketed it without attribution.The name Dastar put on it,instead of Crusade in Europe,was World War II Campaigns in Europe. And you will,I believe,see that in neither opinion does either court take a look at the credits on Dastar's product and conclude that they were in any way misleading,nor does the court examine them at all.

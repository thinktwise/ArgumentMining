We feel no shock when our youth dies in us, though in essence and in truth this is a harder death than the final dissolution of a languishing body in the death of old age. For the leap from uncomfortable being to none at all is not as hard as it is from a flourishing, sprightly being to one that is full of pain and trouble. C. Perelman, L. Olbrechts-Tyteca The New Rhetoric, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 1971, p.348

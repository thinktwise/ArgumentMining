Carol Gilligan, University Professor, New York University School of Law, USA, said she is worried by claims to a "gender-blind admission to patriarchy". She explained that women shouldn t have to fit themselves into a traditional structure built by men. She likened it to someone saying, "Come into my house, come into every room, but it is still my house." The younger generation is saying, let s redesign the house, for both men and women, she continued. "This is not just politically correct, but humanly correct." Women look at the world from a different angle than men do more creatively and their creative voice will be silenced unless it finds resonance, Gilligan said. This change also provides the possibility for men to alter their traditional roles. To bring women into the public world where they have not been before is also to let men experience what they have not had before, she said. Gisele Yitamben, President, Association pour le Soutien et l'Appui la Femme, Cameroon; Social Entrepreneur, said she believes that women CEOs should attempt to "feminize the culture" to change society, to one with more compassion and understanding and not so much war http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Why%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Women%20Is%20Strategically%20%E2%80%93%20Not%20Just%20Politically%20%E2%80%93%20Correct_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

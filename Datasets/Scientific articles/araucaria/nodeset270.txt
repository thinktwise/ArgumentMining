n an open letter to First Minister Jack McConnel, Dr harry Burns, NHS Greater Glasglow's director of public health, backed proposals to impose a ban. In teh letter, Dr burns said, " The link between smoking and Glasgow's ill-health is clear and compelling. Environmental tobacco smoke damages the health of every Scot from the youngest to the oldest. A fundamental principle underlying the way we live out lives in Scotland is that people shouls be free to make choices about how they live their lives -so long as those choices do not harm others. Those of us who work in the Health Service see every day the tragic consequences of exposure to the powerful carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke. The damage done by cigarettes is suffered disproportionately by the poor and if we are serious about narrowing health inequalities we must do what we can to discourage cigarette smoking and to protect the majority of Scots who choose not to smoke from damage to their health.

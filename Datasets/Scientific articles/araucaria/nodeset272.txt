Howard W. Lutnick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Cantor Fitzgerald LP, USA, predicted that investors will increasingly look to the debt markets for signals such as the pricing of default risk that can help them evaluate equity prices. He advocated the creation of new derivative estimates that would allow investors to bet for, or against, the future earnings performance of individual stocks. Such a contract, for example, might pay off if a company meets or exceeds the consensus earnings forecast, but be worthless if it does not. Trading in these contracts, he suggested, would tend to eliminate valuation inefficiencies through the arbitrage process. http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Are%20Financial%20Markets%20Still%20(Somewhat)%20Crazy%20after%20All%20These%20Years%3F_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

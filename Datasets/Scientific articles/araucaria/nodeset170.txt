The material parts of this response can be summarised as follows:       i. Hamdi's detention is lawful since he has been seized by the military and is detained as an enemy combatant;       ii. there is no obligation under the law and customs of war for captors to charge combatants with an offence;       iii. prisoners of war have no right to counsel;       iv. the military has properly determined that Hamdi was an enemy combatant, "the executives' determination that someone is an enemy combatant and should be detained as such [being] one of the most fundamental military judgments of all",       v. the sworn declaration explaining the military's determination readily satisfies any constitutionally appropriate standard of judicial review.     Thus, in essence, the submission is that the war on terrorism is at least the equivalent to a conventional war, the military's judgment as to who is an enemy combatant should be upheld, and the rights available to citizens in relation to ordinary criminal prosecutions, e.g. the right to counsel, and the right to be brought before a court and charged within a reasonable time, are inapplicable.

Before technology, the Mentawai people lived on the land and used the rain forests' resources for their needs. Since the people didn't have the power and/or enough resources to manage, control, and protect the land, the government wanted to take control of it. Their plan for the land was to conserve and use it wisely; to make better homes and schools for the people. I think that the government should take control of the land, that way the land is distributed evenly for the people and not gone to waste, or towards unnessisary needs http://www.teachtsp2.com/cdonline/

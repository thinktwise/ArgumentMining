There were two factors that inspired the Jefferson State concept. The first being that tax money generated in these isolated regions of both states never came back to improve, or build, badly need roads. Most of the so-called highways in these areas at the time became mud holes in the winters and dust bowls during the summer months. Many of the roads resembled mountain trails barely fit for mountain goats. These northern areas of California and southern Oregon were being taxed on the products they produced from their renewable natural resources-the timber, agriculture and mining industries-and receiving no benefits to build better roads from the tax dollars they were obligated to pay. The other reason this movement transpired related to a circumstance that still exists today. The dense metropolitan areas of northern Oregon and the southern areas of our state had a tendency to dictate their political agenda to those residing in the proposed Jefferson State counties and legislators in both state capitols would pass regulatory mandates and legislative laws that most of the citizens in these regions believed to be unwarranted and unnecessary. http://www.jeffersonstate.com/articles/ronparker.html

It appears to us to be too extreme a penalty to strike a solicitor off in circumstances where there is no substantive charge of dishonesty or recklessness; no finding that the Legal Aid Fund (or anybody else) paid out any money in respect of unjustified claims put forward by the solicitor or by staff under her actual supervision; no finding that she was paid anything at all in the course of the matters complained of; no finding of any cash shortage in relation to any of her clients; and no previous conviction which related to a period earlier than the offences with which she was now charged.

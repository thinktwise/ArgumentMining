You, who are a king over a multitude ought not to be of the same mind as men at large, convinced that you do not appraise what things are worthy or what men are wise by the standard of the pleasure they bring you, but that you test them in the light of their practical value C. Perelman, L. Olbrechts-Tyteca The New Rhetoric, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 1971, p.366

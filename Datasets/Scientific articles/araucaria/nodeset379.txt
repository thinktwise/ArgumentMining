I think that the people who live and work on the land should be the ones to profit from it.Opinion #3 is the opinion I agree with the most. The Mentawai people live their lives in Siberut without electricity, radios, televisions, and computers. They work hard to make their food, medicine, and building materials. The Mentawai know the land better than anyone else. They live off of this land and i think that they should profit from it. I think the government should give the Mentawai the land to grow their crops and get their medicine from. They have lived in this place for a long time and it would be very sad if they couldn't stay there because the government took their land away. http://www.teachtsp2.com/cdonline/

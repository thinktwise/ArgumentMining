Russia reserves the right to carry out pre-emptive strikes on foreign militant bases in the wake of the schook hostage seizure, the country's defence minister has said. Defence minister Sergei Ivano said any strike "may involve anything, except nuclear weapons".  "They have declared a war on us, we have come under attack, so all means are good in a war", he said.

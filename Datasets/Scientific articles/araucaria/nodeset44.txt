The proposal to give others equity participation in the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a public sector undertaking, makes one feel that we are faltering in our determination to be self-sufficient. We have already sold proven oil fields for a song. The question arises why we should be disinvesting in a company like the ONGC. It is making good money and the oil, whether drilled from the field or processed in a refinery, is still a strategic commodity for the country.

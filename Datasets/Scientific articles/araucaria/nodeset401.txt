Amre Moussa, Secretary-General, League of Arab States, Cairo, took issue with the idea that there are different forms of Islam that permit excesses. "Islam is a religion for all of us who believe in it. There are bad people who are giving us a bad time at this particular juncture. But the same applies to all religions." And like all other religions, Islam aims to help people in their daily lives and bring happiness. Government has the same aim and democracy as a system of government "has proven to be more effective and better than any other system." So there is no inherent contradiction between Islam and democracy http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/A%20Dialogue%20about%20Islam%20and%20Democracy_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

We should not forget that the great majority of foreign hostages (if not all) went to Iraq of their own free choice and in many cases went because of the financial rewards. They must have weighed the risks against the rewards. This does not mean I am indifferent or unsympathetic to their plight, but I just don't think that the British, American (or any other government with citizens in Iraq) should be expected to give in to the kidnappers demands (and yes, I know I would probably be of a different opinion if I or someone close to me was in Ken Bigley's position)

The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) is interested in doing away not only with the DTI but with nuclear energy. Is my hon. Friend aware that if we had substituted gas-fired power stations for British Energy production, we would have created an extra 27 million tonnes of carbon emissions from August 2003 to August 2004? Is he not concerned about our being dependent on gas in future, and our losing energy production capacity in this country? http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm040916/debtext/40916-02.htm#40916-02_wqn0

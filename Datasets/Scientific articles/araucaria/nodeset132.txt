Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am sincerely disappointed about An anonymous hold has been placed on S. 2043, the "Veterans Long-Term Care and Medical Programs Enhancement Act of 2002." There is no apparent reason why this important piece of legislation should be held up at this time. S. 2043 was developed in a bipartisan manner and S. 2043 encompasses many vital pieces of legislation from both sides of the aisle

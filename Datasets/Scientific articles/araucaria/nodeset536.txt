We ask at the same time that you not lose sight of the larger picture in Iraq. Today, thousands of American soldiers are building schoolhouses. They re shaking hands with young children. They re refurbishing hospitals. They re installing sanitation systems. Every day in Iraq, American soldiers, 18-, 19-, 20-year-old soldiers, perform thousands of acts of kindness and courage, just as they have done around the world in so many places, as they went to secure peace for others, to bring freedom for others. We re proud of these wonderful young men and women. We are proud of those who volunteered to go in service of their nation and to go in service of the cause of peace around the world. Our heads bow, our hearts ache, over what a small number of them did at that prison. There s no excuse for that. But at the same time, take into account the magnificent work of so many of these youngsters, who have left their homes in America to serve in Iraq, to serve in other parts of the world where freedom has been at risk and is at risk, and their willingness to do this as members of a proud organization, the United States Armed Forces, and its representatives of a nation that does not seek dominion over anyone else. We seek sovereignty over no one else. The United States always comes to help, to lend a hand. To assist others on a path forward; to end poverty; to fight disease; to bring hope of a kind that His Majesty and Jim Wolfensohn spoke about, to any dark corner of the world. You will see our strength now. You will see how we respond to this challenge. You will see that the America that we asked you to believe in is still there. It is still strong. It is still the best hope for peace in this world, as we work with partners around the world http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Remarks+by+US+Secretary+of+State+Colin+Powell

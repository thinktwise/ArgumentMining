Different is often taken to mean inferior by insensitive observers, both Italian and foreign. In much of the recent literature in the social sciences, southern Italy is viewed as an underdeveloped country in comparison with its northern counterpart. The Italian South is unquestionably inferior economically to the North, but economic prosperity is not necessarily a true indicator of the quality of a society s life. While materially 24 impoverished, the South has produced many of Italy s greatest men of letters and affairs. (To cite only a few of her political thinkers of note, she can claim Vico, Cuoco, Mosca, Croce, and Dorso.) She also remains the land of the wondrous scenic beauties described by Goethe in his Italienische Reise, as well as of architectural marvels like the Baroque churches of Apulia. It would be extremely shortsighted to view the South as simply, or even primarily, a place where poverty, illiteracy, poor soil, earthquakes, brigandage, and disease abound.

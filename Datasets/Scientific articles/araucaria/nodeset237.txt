It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons. First, family farmers, absent chapter 12, would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code's other al-ternatives, none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12. Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code, for instance, would require a farmer to liquidate; that is, sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer's credi-tors. Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards. Furthermore, Chapter XI, the Bankruptcy Code's business reorga-nization alternative, is not farmer-friendly in various respects, as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers. Second, recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12, but that this need is apparently increasing. Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year. I in-troduced H.R. 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31, 2003, and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform.

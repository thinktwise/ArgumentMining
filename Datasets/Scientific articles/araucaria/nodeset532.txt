Taizo Nishimuro, Chairman of the Board, Toshiba Corporation, Japan, expressed confidence that Japan's current expansion would prove more durable than the "mini-recoveries" of the 1990s, which failed to lift the Japanese economy out of the deflationary trap left behind by the collapse of the stock market bubble of the 1980s. Japanese banks, he said, are finally making real progress is dealing with non-performing loans. Capital spending is rising, as are corporate profits. "There has been a basic change in the atmosphere," Nishimuro said. On the other hand, consumer spending remains soft, meaning Japanese growth still relies heavily on exports. This could prove problematic if the US expansion falters, or the dollar continues to fall http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/A%20CEO%20Perspective%20on%20the%20World%20Economy_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

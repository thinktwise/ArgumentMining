Christopher Shays, Congressman from Connecticut (Republican), USA, argued that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein has improved the prospects for Middle East peace, despite the chaos and violence that has accompanied the occupation. Hussein s downfall has made it possible to remove American military forces from Saudi Arabia, eliminating a source of friction exploited by Osama bin Laden. These achievements, he said, shouldn t be ignored. http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Is%20There%20a%20Coherent%20US%20Foreign%20Policy%20for%20the%20Middle%20East%3F_2004?open&event_id=1185&year_id=2004 This is the struggle of the two wills, Zebari said. It is the struggle between the Iraqi who wants to build a new country, a tolerant country, and those who want a different kind of Iraq dominated by fear and violence. It s very sad to have to report this tragic incident, but the march goes on and we will not be intimidated. http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Iraqi+Foreign+Minister+Reacts+to+Assassination+of+Governing+Council+President

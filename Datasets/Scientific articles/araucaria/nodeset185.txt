POLITICAL acumen is about setting the political agenda. Going by this token, the Congress has lost in Gujarat, whatever the outcome of the December 12 election in that state. It has allowed the vituperative eloquence of Narendra Modi and Company to seep into its consciousness and cause it to second-guess its opponent, tread warily, speak in whispers. It has allowed itself to be spooked into submission, into donning elaborate masks and disguises. This is obvious in the public pronouncements of its leaders, in the poll strategies of its candidates, and - most of all - in the election manifesto the party released last week.

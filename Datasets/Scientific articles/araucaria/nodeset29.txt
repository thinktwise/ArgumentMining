The first defendant has claimed that 5 Ropemaker Road was never used as offices. The claimant has never worked there. He doubts he has ever been there. Yet Mr. O'Donnell, on the face of it a close associate of the first defendant is contacting the claimant there in respect of the very matters raised by the alleged agreement between the claimant and the first defendant very shortly after, on the claimant's account, that agreement was reached. Moreover, a court would be entitled to infer that the presence of at least four telephones at the address suggests it was being used as offices, as the claimant states. In my view, this evidence tends to support the claimant's account. While of course it does not of itself put the first defendant at Ropemaker Road at the material time, it suggests his account regarding Ropemaker Road is untrue.

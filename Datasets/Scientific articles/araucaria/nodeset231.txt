Mail & Guardian readers can be excused for feeling a little puzzled by developments in the government's HIV/Aids policy last week. "Thabo, Manto deepen Aids row", M&amp;G posters bellowed on Friday. "Government acts on Aids", other media assured us a day later.    Both were on the mark. Prompted by mounting concern about the potential election fallout, and driven by enlightened ministers, there was a Cabinet U-turn on drug treatment for Aids sufferers. But as last week's Aids conference highlighted, denialism persists. For this reason, it is essential to ensure that the proposed national treatment plan actually takes place and that, as far as possible, its implementation is removed from the suffocating hand of the denialists.

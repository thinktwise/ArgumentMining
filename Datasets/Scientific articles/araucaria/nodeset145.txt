"How can he stop him?" The tone of helplessness says it all. Mr Campbell exercises an extraordinary psychological dominance over the Prime Minister. It seems he can get away with anything. He has called him "a prat" in front of one witness, has told him to "get a f------ move on" when he believes a meeting has gone on too long, and instructed him to drop what he is doing and concentrate on something else "because it can't f------ wait".  Watching him once on a mobile phone to Mr Blair, striding up and down and wagging his finger, I felt I was hallucinating: surely here was the Prime Minister issuing orders to an official rather than the other way round? He has allowed television cameras into his office to record a plainly startled Mr Blair stammering out his praises. He has even - at the time of the "Cheriegate" affair before Christmas - briefed against the Prime Minister's own wife. Not since the days of the Wars of the Roses has there been such an over-mighty subject at court.

As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially ob-gyn, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_090304.htm

Summing up the current paradox in the Arab-Israel conflict, Javier Solana Madariaga, EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the EU Council, Brussels, said: "We are as close as we've ever been," to a solution, but there still exists "the worst situation on the ground." What sacrifices must both sides make before peace can come? Can a settlement be reached with the current leadership? "We have a train," said Solana, "but we have not been able to move it a single inch out of the station." Marwan Jamil Muasher, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan, said clear actions need to be taken by both sides. Arab leaders need to forcefully state that "suicide bombings are wrong from a moral and political point of view. Israel needs to clearly and unequivocally state that it will implement the road map in full," including a return to 1967 borders. "There is a real mincing of words" at the moment, Muasher said. As long as a reluctance to recognize the genuine concerns of the other sides exists, peace will not come. http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Breaking%20the%20Vicious%20Circle%20of%20the%20Arab-Israeli%20Conflict_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004

Wicked actions should not be judged by their results, but by the wickedness which they imply. The substance of the wrongdoing may be greater or smaller, but the act in itself comprises neither the greater nor the smaller. If a pilot loses a vessel loaded with gold rather than a barge loaded with straw, there will be some difference in the amount of the loss, but none in the incompetence of the pilot. It is with evil-doing as it is sleeping over a boundary: once outside, the deed is done; however far you go beyond the fence, you add nothing to the wrong of having crossed it C. Perelman, L.
